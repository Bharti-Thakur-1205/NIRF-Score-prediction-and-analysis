# NIRF-Score-prediction-and-analysis
India has its higher educational institute ranking, called the NIRF ranking. It is an annual ranking scheme based on various parameters. So its necessary to have a check on this ranking system and have an analysis of ranks and scores given to universities and colleges.  Our objective is to develop an efficient web app for NIRF score prediction, firstly we need to know which algorithm is less prone to errors and is compatible for our system. In order to do so, we first studied different algorithms and then had a meaningful comparison among them. And once we know which one algorithm is the most suitable we go ahead to make our web app. Now after selecting the compatible algorithm, we will start building our model. Our web app predicting the NIRF scores will be using the multiple linear regression algorithm and front end isdeveloped by using streamlit library.
